Section 2
* When using absolute positioning, the parent element must set position to be relative
* Centering
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%; 
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    - Top and left specifies how much the element should be offset from the container
    - transform moves the element by 50% of its own width and height 

* Keyframes gives us more control over the intermediate steps in a CSS animation
